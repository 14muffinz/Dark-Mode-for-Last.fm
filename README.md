# Last.fm Dark Mode

! This is a fork created by 14Muffinz. It uses the same base as s4r1n4, but has been modified to stick more closesly to last.fm's red colour scheme. !
! 14Muffinz also has little to no knowledge of how Github works, so if forking _wasn't_ what I was supposed to do, please let me know. !

A simple Chrome extension that applies a dark mode theme to [last.fm](https://www.last.fm).  
It improves readability and reduces eye strain while keeping all Last.fm features fully accessible.
